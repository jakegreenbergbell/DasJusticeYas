# Searching For Justice

According to the Innocence Project, since late 2019 more than 160 people awaiting capital punishment have been freed from death row in the United States.

Through no fault of their own, they became trapped in a broken system. Some spent more than 30 years for a crime they did not even commit.

Come explore their faces and their stories. Sometimes statistics does not explain the whole brutal emotional toll. Instead, we must see with our own eyes the faces of these people
wronged by a system that must be changed.
